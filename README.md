# Project Title: Predicting Heart Disease Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Introduction
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease risk can be life-saving. In this project, we aim to build and evaluate different supervised machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors.

## Dataset
We will use the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset, which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). This dataset contains 303 instances and 14 attributes, including age, sex, cholesterol level, resting heart rate, and more. The target variable is binary, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop and compare different supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting heart disease. We will evaluate the following algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:
    - Handling missing values.
    - Encoding categorical variables (if any).
    - Scaling numerical features.
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Model Building:
    - Implementing the above-mentioned supervised learning algorithms.
    - Hyperparameter tuning for each algorithm.

3. Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluating model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
    - Comparing the performance of different algorithms.

4. Model Interpretation:
    - Visualizing important features and their impact on predictions.
    - Interpreting the models to gain insights into the factors contributing to heart disease.

5. Conclusion:
    - Summarizing the findings.
    - Recommending the most effective machine learning model for heart disease prediction.

## Project Implementation
We will implement the project using Python and popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Each supervised learning algorithm will be trained, evaluated, and compared using a standardized approach to ensure a fair assessment.

## Expected Outcome
We anticipate building accurate machine learning models that can predict the presence or absence of heart disease with high reliability. The project's output will include model performance metrics, visualizations, and a report summarizing the findings.
